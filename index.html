 <!-- Bootstrap documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/ -->

<!-- General: If the attached png has something going all the way to the sides it's supposed to stretch to the edge of users screen. 
	If there's clearly empty room (like in Nakkivene Ry section) the content is supposed to be within Bootstrap "container" 
	https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/layout/overview/#containers


We like clear division of content so with header, red-strip, Nakkivene Ry section etc. we hope that you'd use <section> tag as the outest tag.
Div content is most often within:
<section class="py-5> (Check out what py-5 does. It's useful in other parts aswell)
	<div class="container">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="cols of different sorts">

			As a software developer, the software solution that gooders provide piqued my interest. When reviewing the job
			requirements and your website, I was excited to see that my qualifications and personal traits align with your
			needs and mission.
		</p>
		<p class="text-center text-capitalize  text-dark">
			I bring a set of talents that I believe will be valuable to kooders. In my computer engineering teacher and
			students advisor role in my home country, my master's education that I am finishing here at the university of
			eastern Finland and software developer for the Joensuu science society ry, I honed my abilities in
			understanding different languages (javascript, PHP, react, Node js, c/c++, java, and python) as well as the ionic
			framework. as well as understanding major AI concepts in machine learning and robotics and implementing
			them with help of some libraries( like TensorFlow or NumPy or panda). which provides a solid foundation for
			the web developer position in your organization. my experience with programming hardware devices, robotics,
			and google cloud platform make me a stored potential for developing IoT solutions and other related projects.
			My collaboration strength, people-centric nature, and eagerness to please have afforded me excellent
			interpersonal skills.
		</p>
		<p class="text-center text-capitalize  text-dark">
			I am excited to contribute my strengths and proficiency in communication to your team efforts. As an
			extroverted and personable communicator, my focus on building strong professional relationships has been a
			valuable asset throughout my career. You may notice a gap in my employment while reviewing my resume.
			During this period, I elected to take a leave from the workforce in order to go back to school. The time that I was
			able to commit to my education has been invaluable to my professional growth, and I am eager to re-enter the
			professional sphere and apply my new found qualifications and knowledge to the job.
		</p>
		<p class="text-center text-capitalize  text-dark">
			Please review my resume and collection of projects for a complete collection of my work history and
			accomplishments. I would like to schedule an interview at your earliest convenience and will contact you next
			week to check on your availability. I look forward to discussing how my personality and work history fit the
			Robotics Development role.
